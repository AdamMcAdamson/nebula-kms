# Nebula KMS

The Nebula Key Management Service (KMS) is the service which manages the API keys for the APIs offered by [Nebula Labs](https://www.utdnebula.com/) for internal, partner, and public developement teams.

This was developed as part of Nebula Platform, which was Architected solely by the relevant contributors. I served as Nebula Labs' API & Platform Lead, and worked with our Head of Engineering [dlaunikitis](https://github.com/dlaunikitis), UTD Survival Guide Lead [williecubed](https://github.com/williecubed), and frontend developer [LudoLogical](https://github.com/LudoLogical), who was developing Nebula Labs' component library at the time.

I was personally responsible for architecting the backend solutions and developing the KMS API, and as the Nebula Labs' API & Platform Lead, delivery of the project as a whole.

I have uploaded this repository to document my development efforts on the KMS API and the wider Nebula Platform which is otherwise not visible to the public for security reasons. This is the state of Nebula KMS and Nebula Platform as of April 2023, and is not reflective of current Nebula deployments.
