### Story

As a [user|developer|project lead|developer portal admin], I want to...
This should be a short (!) explanation of the desired functionality from a user perspective.

### Description

Use this freeform section to explain the intended functionality from our perspective. You may want to:

1. Disambiguate
2. Break the problem into subtasks
3. Identify associations with other project components

### Acceptance Criteria

1. These are how we evaluate whether an issue can be closed.
2. They should be written in the present tense and cover both nominal and exceptional situations when applicable.
3. Ideally, all edge cases should be considered here as well.
4. Example: "Returns a 401 if the supplied API key is not found in the database"
5. Example: "Redirects to platform.utdnebula.com/signin if a valid identity JWT is not supplied"

### Notes

Use this section to write down anything that does not belong in the other sections. This can include links, things to discuss in meetings, and status updates not communicable via labels.
